# STC TV Subscription WebSite Automation

This project automates the validation of subscription packages for the STC TV website for three different countries (Egypt, UAE, Iraq). 
It uses Selenium WebDriver to navigate the subscription home page, extract subscription & country details, and validate the packages based on type, price, and currency. 
Allure is used for generating detailed test reports.

## Data Validation

- The test cases validate the subscription package types, prices, and currencies by comparing them against expected values defined in the CountrySubscriptionData class.
- If any discrepancies are found, the tests will fail, and the details will be logged in the Allure test report.

## Project Structure
- *HomePage.java*: Handles locators & interactions with the subscription Homepage.
- *CountrySubscriptionData*: Supplies Packages details (type,price currency) for each country for testing.
- *SubscriptionPackagesTest.java*: Executes tests for subscription validation.
